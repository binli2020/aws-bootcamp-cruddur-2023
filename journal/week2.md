# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Learn **what is observability**
* https://www.honeycomb.io/resources/intro-to-o11y-topic-1-what-is-observability
* Watched other Training Videos

## About log in to the app
* Looks like everytime need to **sign up** with a dummy email and use `1234` as the reference code
 
## Watching YT video of the living session
* Jessica: use different Dockerfile for 'development' and 'production' containers.
  - 'development' container needs a base image with more utilities installed
  - 'production' container needs a slimmer base image without, i.e. vim, ssh, to make it smaller in size and securer.
