- SAML
> SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).
> 
> SAML enables single sign-on (SSO) for web applications and provides a way to exchange authentication and authorization data between separate security domains. When a user logs in to a service provider, the service provider sends a SAML request to the identity provider, which then authenticates the user and sends a SAML response back to the service provider with information about the user's identity and permissions.
> 
> SAML is widely used in enterprise and government environments to enable secure and seamless access to web applications, and is often used in conjunction with other security technologies such as OAuth and OpenID Connect.
