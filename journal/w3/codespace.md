Configure and Use GitHub Codespace

# [What is GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)
> A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing [configuration files](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.
> 
> Each codespace you create is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. You can choose from a selection of virtual machine types, from 2 cores, 8 GB RAM, and 32 GB storage, up to 32 cores, 64 GB RAM, and 128 GB storage.
